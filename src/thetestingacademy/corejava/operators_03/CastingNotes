Type casting can be done in two ways:
o Implicit casting
o Explicit Casting

Implicit casting:
When type casting is happening automatically by the compiler then it is called as Implicit Casting.



Explicit Casting:
When type casting is happening explicitly by the programmer then it is called as Explicit Casting.
There are two types of conversions:
o Widening
o Narrowing

Widening
 Widening is the process of converting lower type to higher type. This is safe conversion.
 Ex:
 byte b=10;
 int a=b; // VALID – Implicit Casting
 int a= (int)b; // VALID – Explicit Casting

Narrowing
 Narrowing is the process of converting higher type to lower type.
 Ex:
 int a=300;
 byte b=a; // INVALID – Implicit Casting
 byte b = (byte)a; // VALID – Explicit Casting


 int a=300; -> int means 32 bits memory required
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
 byte b1=(byte)a; -> byte means 8 bits memory required
 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
 Value is
 0 * 27 + 0 * 26 + 1 * 25 + 0 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 1 * 22 + 0 * 21 + 0 * 20
 0 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 44.
